title: PLACEHOLDER - My Running Data Platform + the Reality of Data Science
---

Outside of my full time work commitments I like to run. I have done so for the majority of my life. I have been training seriously throughout university and my working life. I have found it challenging but rewarding to balance both athletic, academic and working commitments. This has led to me breaking 4-minutes for the mile and running 13:28 for the 5km, a time which ranks me 9th in the UK in 2023. I have represented England multiple times and I'm currently a member of the England Athletics Develpoment Hub programme based out of St. Mary's University in South West London.

Whilst I'm not yet good enough to be a full time professional. I'm lucky enough to have help from [SOAR running](https://www.soarrunning.com/). Here's an [article](https://www.soarrunning.com/blogs/news/the-way-back) I wrote for SOAR back in 2022 about recovering from injury. I do enjoy having my running outside of work to focus on, and vice-versa, it stops me from going all in on any one thing. Preventing burnout. Now I have balance, I find that each complements the other quite nicely.
